# Modelling-reproduction-evolution-and-information-theory
This repository contains simulations and a pdf of presentation for Boltzmann session for a simple model of evolution by asexual and sexual reproduction. 
Asexual reproduction is by simple mutations, while sexual reproduction can be a mixture of random combination from parents and mutations.
The model is based on topic 19 of David McKay's book: information Theory, Learning and Inference
